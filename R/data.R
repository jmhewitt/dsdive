#' Simulated three stage dive
#' 
#' The \code{dive.sim} object contains the complete simulated dive trajectory 
#' and as a corresponding set of observations in addition to the model 
#' parameters and other features used to generate and analyze the dive.  The 
#' purpose of the dataset is to provide illustrations of data formats 
#' compatible with the \code{dsdive} package, and also provide pre-computed 
#' outputs that may be worked with immediately when exploring and testing the 
#' package.
