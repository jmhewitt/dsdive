\title{Compute transition matrix for Markov chain representation of dive model}
\usage{
dsdive.tx.matrix(
  t0,
  depth.bins,
  beta,
  lambda,
  sub.tx,
  surf.tx,
  inflation.factor.lambda = 1,
  min.depth = 1,
  max.depth = nrow(depth.bins),
  t0.dive,
  lambda.max = NULL,
  t.stage2,
  model
)
}
\arguments{
\item{t0}{time at which transition parameters should be computed}

\item{depth.bins}{\eqn{n x 2} Matrix that defines the depth bins.  The first 
column defines the depth at the center of each depth bin, and the second 
column defines the half-width of each bin.}

\item{beta}{\eqn{2 x 3} matrix in which each column contains the diving 
preference and directional persistence parameters for the DIVING, SUBMERGED, 
and SURFACING dive stages.}

\item{lambda}{length 3 vector that specifies the transition rate, 
respectively in the DIVING, SUBMERGED, and SURFACING stages.}

\item{sub.tx}{length 2 vector that specifies the first depth bin at which 
transitions to the SUBMERGED stage can occur and the probability that such 
a transition occurs at the next depth transition}

\item{surf.tx}{parameter that specifies the probability the trajectory will 
transition to the SURFACING stage at the next depth transition}

\item{inflation.factor.lambda}{In order to facilitate bridged transitions, 
the transition rate of the overall process must be inflated to allow the 
possibility of self-transitions.  Self-transitions allow bridged paths to 
dynamically modify the total number of transitions between observed values
so that a valid path between observations is always possible.  The 
\code{inflation.factor.lambda} parameter implicitly controls the number of 
self-transitions that will occur.  Larger values will create more 
self-transitions.}

\item{min.depth}{As a computational efficiency option, only compute 
transition parameters for depth bins at and above \code{min.depth}.}

\item{max.depth}{As a computational efficiency option, only compute 
transition parameters for depth bins at and below \code{max.depth}.}

\item{t0.dive}{Time at which dive started}

\item{lambda.max}{Arrival rate for the parent Poisson process that will
be thinned.  \code{lambda.max} will be scaled by}

\item{t.stage2}{time at which second stage was entered}

\item{model}{Either \code{"conditional"} or \code{"logit"} depending on the 
method used to determine stage transition probability curves}
}
\description{
Given model parameters and transition times, the 3 stage dive model can be 
represented as a Markov chain over a state space where each state records
the last depth bin, current depth bin, and current dive stage.  This 
function computes the complete transition matrix for the state space, given 
model parameters and time at which the transition will take place.
