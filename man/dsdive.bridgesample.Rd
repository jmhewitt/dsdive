\title{Impute dive trajectories that meet start and end times}
\usage{
dsdive.bridgesample(depth.bins, d0, d0.last, df, beta, lambda, sub.tx,
  surf.tx, t0, tf, s0, inflation.factor.lambda = 1.1, verbose = FALSE,
  precompute.bridges = TRUE, lambda.max = NULL, t0.dive)
}
\arguments{
\item{depth.bins}{\eqn{n x 2} Matrix that defines the depth bins.  The first 
column defines the depth at the center of each depth bin, and the second 
column defines the half-width of each bin.}

\item{d0}{the depth bin at which the trajectory begins}

\item{d0.last}{the depth bin from which the trajectory entered \code{d0}.
Set \code{d0=NULL} if the trajectory is beginning at the surface depth bin.}

\item{df}{the depth bin at which the trajectory should end}

\item{beta}{\eqn{2 x 3} matrix in which each column contains the diving 
preference and directional persistence parameters for the DIVING, SUBMERGED, 
and SURFACING dive stages.}

\item{lambda}{length 3 vector that specifies the transition rate, 
respectively in the DIVING, SUBMERGED, and SURFACING stages.}

\item{sub.tx}{length 2 vector that specifies the first depth bin at which 
transitions to the SUBMERGED stage can occur and the probability that such 
a transition occurs at the next depth transition}

\item{surf.tx}{parameter that specifies the probability the trajectory will 
transition to the SURFACING stage at the next depth transition}

\item{t0}{time at which the trajectory should start}

\item{tf}{time at which the trajectory should end}

\item{s0}{dive stage in which the trajectory begins}

\item{inflation.factor.lambda}{In order to facilitate bridged transitions, 
the transition rate of the overall process must be inflated to allow the 
possibility of self-transitions.  Self-transitions allow bridged paths to 
dynamically modify the total number of transitions between observed values
so that a valid path between observations is always possible.  The 
\code{inflation.factor.lambda} parameter implicitly controls the number of 
self-transitions that will occur.  Larger values will create more 
self-transitions.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, then the sampler's progress will be printed 
during sampling.}

\item{precompute.bridges}{If \code{TRUE}, then the bridged transition 
matrices will be precomputed.  Enabling this option will increase the 
memory overhead of the method, but will reduce its runtime.}

\item{lambda.max}{Arrival rate for the parent Poisson process that will
be thinned.  \code{lambda.max} will be scaled by 
\code{inflation.factor.lambda}, and if \code{lambda.max==NULL} then the 
method will compute this on its own.}

\item{t0.dive}{Time at which dive started}
}
\description{
Sample a dive trajectory such that its start and end locations and times are 
fixed.  Sampling uses a thinned Poisson process and bridged Markov chain 
transition probabilities.  Sampling is not from the model's theoretical 
imputation distribution, but an approximation thereof.  The trajectory's
log-density is returned with the output.
